    <h1 class="my-4">The Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      In the modern world, we spend most of our lives sitting. Be it for work, school, or recreation, the average person spends a large portion of their day sitting in front of computer. Employees with white color jobs typically spend nearly 8 hours a day in front of their computer at work. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the same can be said for students, who have been relegated to online classes taken from their desks at home. According to an analysis, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the average American spends over 6 hours a day sitting down, an increase from a similar study done in 2007. For teenagers ages 12 to 19, this number is even higher at 8 hours a day. Spending time sitting means more time where our seated posture matters. And unfortunately for us, our posture can have real effects on our health. Poor posture has been linked to headaches and neck pain, a decrease in shoulder mobility, and weakness in the abdominal and buttock muscles. Furthermore, poor posture can have negative impacts on the respiratory system. With time spent sitting rising, and the potential impacts of poor posture, we were motivated to create this project: a posture detecting chair.

    <h1 class="my-4">Solution</h1>
    <p>
      Our solution is...
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-4">The System</h2>
    <p>
      Description...
      Sensors on chairs, collect data with esp32 and send over bluetooth to front end Android application...
    </p>

    <h3 class="my-4">Front end: Android Application</h3>
    <p>
		&emsp;The mobile application on Android is written in Java using Android studio. The application will be used to offer both immediate and long term feedback to the user.
		When the user assumes an improper posture, the app will produce a notification to alert the user to fix their posture. As the user sits on the cushions, pressure sensor data will be
		collected through the Arduino. This data is formatted into an array so that each element corresponds to the reading of a single sensor. It is then transmitted wirelessly via bluetooth
		to the pre-trained machine learning model, which classifies the posture. Pressure sensor data will be sent to the model periodically to be classified so
		that any improper posture may be immediately detected.
		<br></br>
		&emsp;The classification model will be custom made for each user. In order to use the application, each user must create an account and go through a calibration phase where the user is told 
		to sit in various postures. During calibration, sensor data is collected and sent to the server where it is used to train an unique classification model for the user. The model is then converted
		to pmml file format, sent back to the application, and stored in the user's mobile device. In future uses of the application, the pmml file can be quickly loaded into a classifier in Java
		that allows us to perform classification directly on the client side. We hope that this will reduce latency during classification and make it as real-time as possible since there would be
		no delays from network requests.
		<br></br>
		&emsp;In the long term, the application will attempt to find patterns of bad posture in the data in order to suggest appropriate exercises to fix them. Users will have the ability to view historic 
		posture data as well as analytic on that posture set.

    </div>
    <p>
      We created custom pressure sensors using a piezo-resistive mateiral called Velostat. For our conductors, wires were soldered to cooper tape, and one stirp of copper tape was placed on each side ofthe Velostat. Each side of the Velostat was then covered with aluminum foil, and regular tape was used to keep the aluminum foil, copper tape, and Velostat compressed against each other. Using this method, we can construct sensors of any size and of any number, which allow us to easily change the placement pattern of our sensor array if needed.
    </p>


    <h3 class="py-3">Microprocessor Chip</h3>

    <img class="d-inline px-4 esp32" src="res/img/tech/esp32Espressif.png">
    </div>
    <p>
      The microprocessor chip we used was the ESP32-WROOM-32 module. The module has built in Bluetooth and WiFi capabilites, allowing for wireless transfer of sensor data to the Android application.
    </p>

    <h3 class="my-4">Classification Algorithm</h3>
	<p>
		&emsp;The machine learning algorithm used to classify the postures is logistic regression. Logistic regression is a classification technique which finds a linear decision boundary to separate multiple
		classes. For instance, to separate two postures, the classifier finds a vector of coefficients w = (w<sub>1</sub>,...,w<sub>m</sub>) such that
		w<sup>T</sup> f = <span class="span_equation">&Sigma;</span> w<sub>l</sub>*f<sub>l</sub> is positive for feature values f = (f<sub>1</sub>,...,f<sub>m</sub>) from one posture, and negative for
		the other. For k postures, logistic regression models the conditional likelihood of posture j, P(y = j | F = f)
		given features F = f as:
		<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto my-4" src="res/img/math/lr_equation.png" alt="LR Equation">
		where w<sub>j</sub> are posture specific vectors found by the training algorithm. In order to
		classify an unseen observation f, the algorithm would select the most probable posture, i.e., select j such
		that P(y = j | F = f) is maximized.
		<br></br>
		&emsp;The posture classification model will be built in Python and will primarily use the Scikitlearn
		library. Using the data collected, logistic regression models are train and evaluated. K-fold cross-validation will be the
		main method used to tune hyper-parameters and select the model with the best accuracy. In addition, the
		confusion matrix will be used for evaluation in order to ensure the occurrences of false positives are kept at a
		minimum.
